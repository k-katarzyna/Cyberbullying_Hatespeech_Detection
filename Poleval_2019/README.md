This mini-project is inspired by exercises from the e-learning course ["Machine Learning" by Kodołamacz](https://machinelearning.kodolamacz.pl/). The task originates from the [Poleval competition in 2019 (task 6-2)](https://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6).

The goal is to build a classifier to recognize the type of harmfulness in tweets (non-harmful, cyberbullying and hate-speech).
