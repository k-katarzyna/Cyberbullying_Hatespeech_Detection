This mini-project aims to build a classifier **to recognize the type of harmfulness in tweets** (non-harmful, cyberbullying and hate-speech). The task originates from the [Poleval competition in 2019 (task 6-2)](https://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6).

The project explores:

* lemmatization
* feature extraction methods and their parameters
* class balancing methods
* different classification algorithms

The progress, results and comments can be found in the *main.ipynb* notebook, as well as summary and conclusions. The *utils.py* file contains utilities for the project.
