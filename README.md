This mini-project aims to build a classifier **to recognize the type of harmfulness in tweets** (non-harmful, cyberbullying and hate-speech). The task originates from the [Poleval competition in 2019 (task 6-2)](https://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6).

**The project is still in progress** and explores:

* lemmatization
* feature extraction methods and their parameters
* class balancing methods
* different classification algorithms
